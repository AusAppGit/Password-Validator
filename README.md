# Password-Validator
A code response to Sololearn's Code Coach Challenge titled, "Password Validation". The code should take a string as input to evaluate. Output is a string "Strong" or "Weak" depending on the characters within the string.
Requirements for a strong password = 2+ numbers, 2+ special characters, minimum length of 7 characters.
*** NOTE! ***
This is not the standard for a strong password!
